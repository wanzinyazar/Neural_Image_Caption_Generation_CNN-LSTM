# Neural_Image_Caption_Generation_CNN-LSTM



dataset request, https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398 developed a neural image caption generation model 

Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem: it requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.

This repo consists of designing and training a deep learning caption generation mode to caption entirely new photographs along with how to prepare photo and text data for training a deep learning model.
